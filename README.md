## BadXClone
https://badxclone.com/

A barebones Twitter-like social media site written in pure HTML, CSS, and JS
using MySQL and a basic API using PHP

This project is essentially meant to test my understanding of database systems
and apply my understanding of relational databases to real-world applications (using a LAMP stack)

## Roadmap
- [ ] API implementation
- [ ] UI additions
- [ ] Account system
